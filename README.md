Expense Tracker Web App using Microsoft ASP.Net Core


An Expense Tracker Web App built using ASP.NET Core is a comprehensive application designed to manage and track personal or business expenses. It allows users to log, categorize, and analyze their expenses over a specified period, providing insights into their spending habits. Below is a brief description of how such an app can be built, incorporating Syncfusion for UI styling and components:

Key Features:
User Authentication and Authorization:

Users can add, edit, and delete transactions for income and expenses.
Each transaction can be categorized (e.g., groceries, entertainment, bills).
Transactions are displayed in a table, along with a date, category, and amount.
Dashboard:

A dashboard provides a quick overview of the user’s financial status.
Key data like total income, total expenses, and the balance are displayed.
Data visualization includes charts and graphs to analyze spending trends, such as a doughnut chart for expense distribution and a spline chart for income vs. expense tracking over time.
Reports:

Users can view and generate reports based on different time frames (weekly, monthly, yearly).
Summary reports show detailed analysis of income vs. expenses.
Category Management:

Users can create and manage categories for their transactions (income or expense).
Categories are shown with icons for easy identification, utilizing Syncfusion's UI capabilities.
Real-time Data Filtering:

The app allows filtering of transactions by date range, category, or type (income/expense).
Advanced searching and sorting options are available to make data retrieval faster.
Technology Stack:
ASP.NET Core:

Backend API development and MVC pattern for the web interface.
Entity Framework Core (EF Core) is used to interact with a relational database (e.g., MySQL or SQL Server) for storing transactions, categories, and user data.
Syncfusion:

UI Components: Syncfusion provides a set of rich, modern UI components such as Grids, Charts, and Data Visualizations to enhance the look and feel of the app.
Charts and Graphs: Used to display financial data like income vs. expenses, categorized expenses, and transaction trends.
Styling: Syncfusion's form controls like TextBoxes, Dropdowns, Numeric Textboxes, and Date Pickers ensure a smooth user experience with consistent styling.
Database:

A database (such as MySQL or SQL Server) is used to store the data related to users, transactions, categories, and other business logic.
Entity Framework Core:

EF Core handles database communication, ensuring smooth CRUD operations for transactions, categories, and user information.
RESTful APIs:

The app can expose certain functionalities via REST APIs for integration with mobile or third-party platforms.
Syncfusion Integration:
Grids: Syncfusion’s DataGrid is used for listing and managing transactions, offering features like sorting, filtering, and pagination.
Charts: Doughnut charts for showing expense by category and spline charts for income vs. expenses.
Forms: Syncfusion form components like TextBoxes, NumericTextBox (for amounts), and DropDownList (for category selection) are used for managing transaction inputs.
Responsive Design: Syncfusion's responsive components ensure the app works seamlessly across devices, including mobile, tablet, and desktop views.
